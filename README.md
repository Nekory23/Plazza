The purpose of this project is to make you realize a simulation of a pizzeria, which is composed of the reception that accepts new commands, of several kitchens, themselves with several cooks, themselves cooking several pizzas.

You will learn to deal with various problems, including load balancing, process and thread synchronization and communication.

Before you get started, should take some time to read up on the following tools youâ€™ll need to use:
- Processes ( man fork , man exit , man wait , man ... )
- Inter-process communication (IPC)
- STL threads
- POSIX threads ( man pthread_* )

See the subject for further details !
